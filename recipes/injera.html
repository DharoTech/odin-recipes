    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Injera is a traditional Ethiopian and Eritrean flatbread known for its unique
        spongy texture and slightly tangy flavor. Made primarily from teff flour—a
        gluten-free, nutrient-rich grain—injera serves as both a plate and utensil in
        East African cuisine. Its porous surface is perfect for soaking up flavorful
        stews like <strong>doro wat</strong> and <strong>misir wat</strong>, making
        every bite a delicious combination of texture and taste. Fermented for a few
        days to develop its signature sourness, injera is as much a cultural staple as
        it is a versatile and healthy accompaniment to many traditional dishes.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups teff flour (or a mix of teff and all-purpose flour)</li>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Oil or cooking spray (for the pan)</li>
            <li>Optional: a small amount of starter or yeast to aid fermentation</li>
        </ul>
    </div><br>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the teff flour and water. Stir until smooth and lump-free.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with a clean cloth and let it sit at room temperature for 2–3 days to ferment. You’ll know it’s ready when it smells slightly sour and bubbles form on the surface.</li>
            <li>Once fermented, gently stir in the salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat a non-stick skillet or specialized injera pan over medium heat. Lightly grease it with oil or cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Pour a thin layer of the batter onto the pan, swirling it quickly to cover the surface evenly.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook for 1–2 minutes until the surface is set and filled with bubbles. Do not flip.</li>
            <li>Carefully remove the injera and let it cool on a clean cloth. Repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Serve warm with traditional Ethiopian stews or curries.</li>
        </ol>
